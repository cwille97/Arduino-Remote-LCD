Purpose: This program will allow you to press a button on the remote and display the button you pressed on the LCD panel. I was hoping to make this program a little more interactive, my full idea was to enter a Zip code via the remote and then send it via HTTP request and get the current weather for that zip code. However this Arduino is not WiFi enabled so I'll need to wait to get some sort of WiFi module before I can experiment with that. 

Required Hardware: This requires an Arduino UNO, a breadboard,  LCD1602 module, 10k potentiometer, several m-m and m-f wires, IR remote and received module. I used the Elegoo  super starter kit for UNO R3 which I got on Amazon. 

Instructions: 
Make sure to add all libraries to the IDE. Wiring diagrams available in media folder. The diagrams shown try to use the same pin so I reassigned the IR received to pin 5 and made that adjustment in the code. See photo of wiring as well.
